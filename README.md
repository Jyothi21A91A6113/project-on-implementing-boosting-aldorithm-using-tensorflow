Boosting improves machine models' predictive accuracy and performance by converting multiple weak learners into a single strong learning model.
Machine learning models can be weak learners or strong learners 
 Weak learners have low prediction accuracy, similar to random guessing. 
They are prone to overfitting—that is, they can't classify data that varies too much from their original dataset.
 Strong learners have higher prediction accuracy. Boosting converts a system of weak learners into a single strong learning system.
TensorFlow:TensorFlow is a Google-maintained open-source framework for prototyping and assessing machine learning models, primarily neural networks.
TensorFlow is written in a variety of languages. TensorFlow is generally linked with neural networks
